What went well?

Overall, us working on the project back and forth seemed to go quite well. We broke up the different tasks, and each went to work on it. When a problem was found and the one working on it could not find out the solution, the other was able to give some assistance.

We communicated quite a bit about when we got something done, or when we ran into a problem.


---------------------------------

What could be improved?

Maybe have a bigger group to work on this project. That way the tasks could be given up more evenly, and give a chance for someone with a problem, to see two people's ideas as to what went wrong.

As well, finding the time to work on it around all the other assignments due would need some more too.
